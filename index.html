      <p>Hey there good friends. I'm putting this little website togather so that we all have a place we can go to find study materials</p>
      <a href="http://lifehacker.com/the-best-resources-to-learn-to-code-1517844722">Another similar site</a>
      <p>This site is good at getting a decent amount of info out consisely. It looks nice, and is easy to read. The comment section where people can share their own favorite materials is a great touch! Maybe I'll add one of my own!</p>

      <p> Here is a lot of text to show how classes work.</p>
      <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'</p>
      <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="maintext">
      <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
      <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
      The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p>
