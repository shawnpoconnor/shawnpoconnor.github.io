  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>Hey there good friends. I'm putting this little website togather so that we all have a place we can go to find study materials</p>
  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/the-best-resources-to-learn-to-code-1517844722">Another similar site</a>
  <p>This site is good at getting a decent amount of info out consisely. It looks nice, and is easy to read. The comment section where people can share their own favorite materials is a great touch! Maybe I'll add one of my own!</p>
